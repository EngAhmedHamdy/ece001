Most researchers agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to expect AI to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead, when considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely:
1-The AI is programmed to do something devastating
2-The AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal
